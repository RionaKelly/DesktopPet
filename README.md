# Desktop Pet
## Intro
This is a Virtual Pet that I am creating as part of my 3rd year Semester 2 Project. They are a cute digital creature that lives on your desktop and you take care of similar to classic handheld virtual pets such as Tamagotchi and Digmon, while living on your computer like other desktop pets or computer games such as Moshi Monsters. I have loved games like these every since I was a child so they have been a massive inspiration to me and I've always wanted to try make my own version.

## Download Instructions
You can download the app from my itch page here [itch page not ready yet]!
Or  download DesktopPet.exe directly from the **export** folder in the repository on this page.

## Guide
When you open the app for the first time you will hatch a random pet. They will wander around the bottom of your screen where you can watch them, move them around, and play with them.
### Controls
Left-clicking on your pet will stop them from moving and get their attention, holding down this button will allow you to drag your pet around the screen.

Right-clicking on your pet will pet them, making them happier and less bored(with diminishing returns).

Double left-clicking on your pet, allowing you to access certain extra menus and features, such as:
- Storage - Here you will find your purchased food
- Shop - Here you can buy food, accesories, and more.
- Games - Here you can choose games to play with your pet
- Info - Here you can read instructions, information, and credits.
- Settings - Here you can change game settings such as the volume and display options.
- Exit - When selected will save and close the app.
### Raising your pet
Thought bubbles may appear above your pet's head to tell you how they're feeling, usually hungry or bored.

If your pet is hungry, you can feed them using food from your inventory.

Your pet will also sometimes get bored and want attention, petting them will help this a little (as will picking them up) but the best way to help your pet is to play games with them!
